Sena Sinan Report For Project 3

In Task 1, I implemented the draw method for the SceneNode class to ensure that transformations applied to a parent node propagate correctly to its children in the scene graph. To achieve this, I utilized the getTransformationMatrix method from the TRS class, which combines translation, rotation, and scaling into a single transformation matrix. During the draw method, this matrix is applied to the provided model, view, and projection matrices using matrix multiplication, updating them to reflect the current node's transformations. The meshDrawer for the current node is then drawn using these transformed matrices. Finally, I implemented a recursive call to the draw method for each child node, passing down the updated matrices to propagate the hierarchical transformations throughout the scene graph. This ensures a proper rendering hierarchy, allowing transformations of parent nodes (like translation or rotation) to seamlessly affect their children.
